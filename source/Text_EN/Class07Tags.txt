tagSkillClassDescription07=The Engineers of the imperial army were a highly educated group of men and women responsible for impressive war machines and other efficient means of devastation. They rarely saw any frontline action before the grim dawn, but are more than capable of unleashing contraptions on the fly to distract and destroy their enemies. Engineers tend to prefer firearms, but some brash individuals have devised methods to augment their own fists.

tagClass07SkillName01A=Shirley's Shock Shot
tagClass07SkillDescription01A=Shirley was the first to invent a powerful ammunition replacement which was both cheap and easy to produce. These pellets are electrified and have plenty of punch, enough to occasionally shock an enemy off their feet. ^oRequires a ranged weapon. Default attack.
tagClass07SkillName01B=Corona Charge Cartridges

tagClass07SkillName02A=Pascal's Pneumatic Power-Palms

tagClass07SkillName02B=Grandmaster's Greasy Grip

tagClass07SkillName02D=Overpowered Oscillators
tagClass07SkillDescription02D=Pascal's original design can be tweaked to output much more power, but initial testing proved that human arms can't quite handle the stress and are prone to being violently launched across the room. Anyone crazy enough to perform these tweaks had better be careful, but the sheer increase in power may offset lost speed.
