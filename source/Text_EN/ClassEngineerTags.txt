tagSkillClassDescriptionEngineer=The Engineers of the imperial army were a highly educated group of men and women responsible for immense war machines and other efficient means of destruction. They rarely saw any front-line action before the grim dawn, but are nonetheless capable of unleashing contraptions on the fly to destroy their enemies. Engineers tend to prefer firearms, but some brash individuals have devised methods to augment their own fists.

tagClassEngineerSkillName00=Engineer
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription00=Eureka!

tagClassEngineerSkillName01A=Shirley's Shock Shot
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription01A=Shirley was the first to invent a powerful firearm augment which was both cheap and easy to mass-produce. The apparatus connects to ranged weapons and will electrify rounds automatically. These electrified rounds are powerful enough to occasionally shock an enemy off their feet. ^oRequires a ranged weapon. Default attack.
tagClassEngineerSkillName01B=Corona Charge Cartridges
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription01B=Improves the shock apparatus to also cause rounds to release a devastating corona of electric energy when hitting a target.
tagClassEngineerSkillName01C=Curious Condenser
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription01C=Adds an aether condenser to the shock apparatus, causing all fired projectiles to become very brittle and brimming with aetherial energy just waiting to be let out.
tagClassEngineerSkillName01D=Rocket Rounds
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription01D=A bulky revision of Shirley's original design, using an arcane amplifier to add a bit of magical heft to fired rounds. Requires more energy, but packs a much greater punch.

tagClassEngineerSkillName02A=Pascal's Pneumatic Power-Palms
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription02A=Pascal was a rowdy one, obsessed with lining armor with special pneumatic devices to increase the stopping power of punches. The devices take a moment to warm up, but will increase your punching power greatly after that. Unfortunately, his design is surprisingly useless when it comes to swinging a weapon. ^oRequires you to be unarmed. Default attack.
tagClassEngineerSkillName02B=Grandmaster's Greasy Grip
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription02B=A technique inspired by the grandmaster engineer of the imperial army, whose hands always seemed to be covered in oil.
tagClassEngineerSkillName02C=Handy Hazard Hurler
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription02C=Every punch will cause small explosive devices to be launched forward into several nearby enemies' faces at extremely high speeds. Devious, Dangerous, Imperial Engineering.
tagClassEngineerSkillName02D=Overpowered Oscillators
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription02D=Pascal's original design can be tweaked to output much more power, but initial testing proved human arms can't handle the stress. In fact, the first tester's arms launched off his body like missiles after a few moments of intense high-frequency punching. Since having arms is a prerequisite for punching, users of this tweak are advised to slow down a bit.
tagClassEngineerSkillName02E=Ignoring Safety Labels
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription02E=Safety be damned! You want power, and you're confident your arms can handle these things at full capacity. You laugh at the thought of your arms shooting off your torso like missiles! Probably because that's actually a pretty funny thought to have.

tagClassEngineerSkillName03A=Harry's Hands-free Hyper-gadgetry
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription03A=Harry was part of the group of imperial engineers who advocated unarmed combat. In order to impress his superiors and convince them to his cause, he focused on delicate processes for improving gadgets, all of which require the speed and freedom provided by not carrying a weapon to be viable. ^oRequires you to be unarmed.

tagClassEngineerSkillName04A=Samuel's Stationary Sentry
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription04A=A simple stationary turret which exists for the sole purpose of shooting powerful rounds at enemies. No frills. Samuel had plans to make his creation mobile, but that required more power than it was capable of outputting. He settled for a stationary, but powerful, deployable defensive line.
tagClassEngineerPetSentry=Sentry Gun

tagClassEngineerSkillName04B=Lessons Learned: Sentry
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription04B=From using the sentry in combat, you've learned a thing or two about summons and defense.

tagClassEngineerSkillName04C=Iconic Imitation: Sentry
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription04C=Prolonged use of the sentry has given you an idea. You have gained the ability to sacrifice your movement speed for the ability to take on aspects of your Sentry Gun. ^oThis is a toggleable skill.

tagClassEngineerSkillName05A=Connie's Charged Cannonball
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription05A=With a bit of help from some of her arcanist friends, Connie created a gadget which allowed a standard firearm to propel a volatile cannonball forward. With a bit of aetherial energy and a few quick movements to set up a shot, anything is possible! ^oRequires a ranged weapon.

tagClassEngineerSkillName05B=Rapid Replicating Rig
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription05B=It is a well known fact that aether energy is strange, unpredictable, and alien. However, its effects start to get especially strange when you manage to compress enough of it into one small place. Increasing efforts to improve the cannonball firing method led to an amusing discovery: more cannonballs!

tagClassEngineerSkillName05C=Overcharged Ordnance
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription05C=All of this aether nonsense really corrupted the initial goal of the Cannonball project: Crowd control. These modifications aim to help bring the project back to its roots.

tagClassEngineerSkillName06A=Tommy's Turf Turner
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription06A=Tommy saw the appeal of unarmed techniques and gadgets, but not so much for combat. He started using powerful arm augments to help him do his gardening work, and it worked quite well for turning soil. Higher-ups caught wind of this, and asked for his methods to be upgraded for combat use. Reluctantly, Tommy made the required tweaks and his gardening tool became a powerful ground-pound. ^oRequires you to be unarmed.

tagClassEngineerSkillName06B=Pyro Punch
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription06B=Adds a bit of power and a bit of fire. The added power is just enough to start knocking certain targets off their feet.

tagClassEngineerSkillName07A=Stanley's Safe Space 
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription07A=This "Safe Space" machine keeps your enemies at bay with invisible, punishing waves of energy for a short time before breaking down. Stanley made great efforts to sustain the machine longer, but it has the unfortunate tendency of tearing itself apart. This version of the machine is 30% less likely to maliciously reorganize its creator's internal organs. ^oWill remain active for 10 seconds. Active time and effective range will increase with skill level.
tagClassEngineerPetSafeSpace=Safe Space Generator

tagClassEngineerSkillName07B=Lessons Learned: Safe Space 
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription07B=Use of the Safe Space Bot has led you to the discovery of a few defensive techniques. These techniques are applicable to both yourself and your summons.

tagClassEngineerSkillName07C=Iconic Imitation: Safe Space
tagClassEngineerSkillDescription07C=In your attempts to take on aspects of the Safe Space Bot, you found that attempting to release energy similar to the machine was rather unhealthy for your internal organs. Instead, you focused on the aspects of survival which the machine stands for. You can use this to increase your survivability in several aspects. ^oThis is a toggleable skill.
