This mastery now has to use a custom skilltree template. The standard skilltree.tpl template only supports 35 skills,
and I now require more than that. I made a custom template to account for this. The template is ONLY necessary when building the mod,
it doesn't matter if standard players have the file or not.

There is a skilltree_expanded.tpl file in the same directory as this text file.
If you want to be able to build the mod successfully, you will need to place that file into your Grim Dawn\database\templates folder.
