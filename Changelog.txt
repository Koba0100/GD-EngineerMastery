1.5 Changes

Power Palms now works with flat bonus damage and such. Preserving the scaling was extremely awkward, but I don't think I broke anything.
Flamer's range now scales, and does slightly less damage.
Imitate Sentry's %OA is now less nuclear.
Safe space scaling has been changed. Starts with lower damage, Scales higher, cooldown has been increased slightly.
Increased CD of Turf Turner.
Ignoring Safety Labels health drain has been changed a bit. Harder to out-regen it, but still probably possible.
Rework of Hands-Free skill. Again.
Invasive Internal Improvements has had its regen cut a bit.
