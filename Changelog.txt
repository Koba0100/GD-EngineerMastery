1.5 Changes

Power Palms now works with flat bonus damage and such. Preserving the scaling was extremely awkward, but I don't think I broke anything.
Flamer's range now scales, and does slightly less damage.
Imitate Sentry's %OA is now less nuclear.
Safe space scaling has been changed. Starts with lower damage, Scales higher, cooldown has been increased slightly.
Increased CD of Turf Turner.
Ignoring Safety Labels health drain has been changed a bit. Harder to out-regen it, but still probably possible.
Rework of Hands-Free skill. Again.
Invasive Internal Improvements has had its regen cut a bit.

1.6 Changes

Flamer range starts a little lower.
Flamer damage nerf.
Small rework of Turf Turner.
Overpowered Oscillators currently affects EVERYTHING while active. Added -Cast Speed to offset as intended.
Updated Ignoring Safety Labels to also revert the new Cast Speed change.
Crossover skills! Attempted balance, probably failed miserably as usual. Enjoy.
Excruciating Exhaust was a bit underwhelming. Boosted the fire damage a bunch since it's a burst skill anyway.
Pet skills now visibly scale with pet bonuses.
Removed little icon under the exclusive skill. Doesn't need to be there.

Research:
	**PENDING** Summon Skill Maker script to save a lot of time...
	**PENDING** DAIL increased the size of the mastery menu somehow. Figure out how. Probably have to ask unless something obvious jumps out.
